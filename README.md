# Helix Sandbox NG
Helix Sandbox Next Generation

## About

Helix Sandbox is a free back-end platform with a lightweight approach to IoT integration geared towards developing applications for smart environments, presenting a multi-cloud approach that can be executed in any CSP (Cloud Service Providers), hypervisor or bare-metal. 

Our goals:

Innovative microservice architecture, generic enablers orchestration, agnostic cloud service provider, agnostic hypervisors, faster to deploy a wide variety of IoT applications, easier web interface and based on Fiware generic enablers.

Helix simplify the process of installation and configuration through an intuitive graphical interface that enables orchestration of their components.

The integrated architecture is based on the next generation of GE, which enables a new generation of applications for intelligent environments that exploit large-scale and real-time context information in CIM (Context Information Management) based on the NGSI-LD API defined by ETSI (European Network of Telecommunications Standards) as well as for the CEF (Connecting Europe Facility).

Designed for PoCs (Proofs of Concept), Startups MVPs (Minimal Viable Product), Students, Scientific Researches, and Experimental Applications using a few computational resources.

Helix Sandbox NG supports HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) the most popular IoT Broker. Mosquitto is lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices from low power single board computers to full servers.

The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers.

Give your smart environment application the ability to analyse, share, manage and use in real time at right time!
